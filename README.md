# Practice Rollcall

This is a rollcall application where the user will check if a player is at practice or not.

# Purpose
The purpose for this application is for me to learn how to connect client side to server side. I'll be using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and SQLlite. 

As for how this will be set up is still up in the air. There are some concepts I still need to understand; specifically how to store and connect all files using Github, Flask, and possibly Heroku or some free open-source database management host.
