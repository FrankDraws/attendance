# Soccer Practice Attendance Application
This is an attendance application where the user will mark if a player is present or absent. The app will load a simple interface with the current date at the top and a list of players with a checkbox next to their names. The user will then select the players that are present. The app will then save the date, present players, and absent players to a database.

# Purpose
The purpose for this application is for me to learn how to connect client side to server side. I'll be using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and SQLlite. 

As for how this will be set up is still up in the air. There are some concepts I still need to understand; specifically how to store and connect all files using Github, Flask, and possibly Heroku or some free open-source database management host.
